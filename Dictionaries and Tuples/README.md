# Session 6 Dictionaries and Tuples
Dictionaries and tuples are examples of rudimentary yet complex data structures. A dictionary can contain dictionaries within each of its properties. Tuples, on the other hand, are fixed-number collections of values, where its values can be accessed with a syntax similar to how to access an array/list's values, i.e. `variable = example_tuple[0]`.
