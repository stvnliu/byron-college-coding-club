## What is this?

This is a repository of all the templates and code files we will be using in the club. It involves most of what we are planning to teach and is constantly updating.

## What do you need to do from now to the end of the term?
***CHECK TEAMS***  
 
We're delighted to share some exciting news from our coding club. After a discussion with our teacher, we've decided to recognise the hard work and the time you have spent for all coding club members by issuing certificates for those who took part in the final project.  

Here's how it will work: students will have the opportunity to share their project ideas with us, and together, we'll select the final project. However, for those who prefer to work independently, that option is absolutely available as well. If you encounter any issues during the project, feel free to ask us. Also, in the sessions after half term, we will decide on the project first and focus on assisting you with your coding project.  

This initiative aims to celebrate your creativity, teamwork, and the programming skills that you have learned so far. Therefore, whether you're collaborating on the final project or pursuing your own coding projects, your efforts will be acknowledged and appreciated.
If you already have some ideas of what you want to do for the final project, feel free to reply to this message with your thoughts.

The project is under the MIT License. You may use it however you want. But it's basically useless outside of the coding club anyway.
