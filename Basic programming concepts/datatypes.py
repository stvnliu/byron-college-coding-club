# Discussion
# Data types are less useful in Python, since it is not a strongly-typed language.
# However, it is good practice to note down what type a variable is by using the "variable: type"
# syntax. In more complex programs, you will find that type definitions are extremely helpful in 
# managing class-based inheritance and objects with tons of properties and methods. 
# You will find out more in later sessions.
