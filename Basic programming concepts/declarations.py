print("Hello world")

# Declaring variables and constants
# The idea of variables are that they are "abbreviations" 
# of a result of calculation

x = 0 # integer - a whole number
print(x) # print function, outputs the value in question

calc = 6 + 3 # variables as stores of results of calculations
print(calc) # b = 9, the print will output 9

text = "And then there was light" # Strings (Text)
fruits = ["Apple", "Orange", "Watermelon"] # Arrays / lists

# Constants are variables that do not change.

# Boolean (true/false) & constant (not strict)
CAN_MODIFY_DATA = False 
# In Python, there are no rules that regulate what is a constant
# and what is a variable. But usually, we write constants with
# capital letters and underlines to hint other programmers what
# kind of variable this is.
